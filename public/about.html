  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Boago Bravan Olyn, a final-year student at Sol Plaatje University, studying Information and Communication Technology with a focus on Application Development. 
    I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems—especially those faced by students.</p>

  <p>I’ve worked on several projects that reflect this passion,
    including a Second-Hand Books Platform that helps SPU students buy and sell books more easily.
    The idea came after speaking to other students who said WhatsApp groups weren’t reliable for selling or finding affordable books. 
    The platform is designed to be simple, user-friendly, 
    and styled with interactive red and orange themes as per project guidelines.</p>

  <p>I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and apply what I’ve learned.</p>

  <p>Outside of projects and studies, I’m someone who prefers working quietly behind the scenes.
     I deal with social anxiety, but coding has given me a space where I feel confident and creative.
     My goal is to keep building solutions that help others while growing into a stronger developer and communicator.</p>

  <p>Right now, I’m deciding between pursuing an Advanced Diploma or finding a learnership where I can gain hands-on experience. 
    Either way, I’m ready for the next step in my journey.</p>
